I know i3 - **titling window manger** from my friend - Hales and he has been using it for many years.  Impressed by its simplicity and high-efficency, I decided to transfer from Gnome-destop (diverse functions and user-friendly UI but *slow*!) to  it.

## Installation
**i3wm installation**
`sudo apt-get install i3`<br>

This brings you i3-wm, <a href="2020-01-05-i3wm-configuration.md#i3status">i3status</a> and i3lock
