I know i3 - **titling window manger** from my friend - Hales and he has been using it for many years.  Impressed by its simplicity and high-efficency, I decided to transfer from Gnome-destop (diverse functions and user-friendly UI but *slow*!) to  it.

## Installation
**i3wm installation** command line:<br>
```console
	sudo apt-get install i3
```

This brings you i3-wm, [i3status](#i3status) and i3lock.

After it is done, reboot your computer and choose i3 as your window manager before you login.

**Additional packages** which I recommend:

- **Typora**: markdown editor with awesome and user-friendly  UI to help me write online posts.
- [**Rofi**](#Rofi): program launcher similar with
- [**Lxappearance**](#Lxappearance)
-

## HiDpi problem
My laptop is surface-book 1st with the resoultion of 3000$\times$2000. The first problem which I came across is that the fonts are very small and hardly readable. After wandering around stackoverflow, I found the solution [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/267885/how-do-i-scale-i3-window-manager-for-my-hidpi-display). Bascillay, you could modify .Xresources file (located at `~/.Xresources`) where Xft.dpi should be increased (220 works perfectly in my case) and reboot you should see the difference.

## Appearance and Fonts

I am simply in favor of MacOS Fonts and UI and here are  

### Lxappearance 

This software helps you customize the following<br>
* Widget theme: located at `~/.themes`
* Fonts: located at `~/.fonts` 
* Icon theme: located at `~/.icons`
* Cursor theme: located at `/usr/share/icons`
For my personal taste, [MacOs theme](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1275087/) is chosen (the visual effect as shown below).
