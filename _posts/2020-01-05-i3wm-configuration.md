I know i3 - **titling window manger** from my friend - Hales and he has been using it for many years.  Impressed by its simplicity and high-efficency, I decided to transfer from Gnome-destop (diverse functions and user-friendly UI but *slow*!) to  it.

## Installation
**i3wm installation** command line:<br>
`sudo apt-get install i3`<br>

This brings you i3-wm, [i3status](#i3status) and i3lock.

After it is done, reboot your computer and choose i3 as your window manager before you login.

## HiDpi problem
My laptop is surface-book 1st with the resoultion of 3000$\times$2000. The first problem which I came across is that the fonts are very small and hardly readable. After wandering around stackoverflow, I found the solution [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/267885/how-do-i-scale-i3-window-manager-for-my-hidpi-display). Bascillay, you could modify .Xresources file (located at `~/.Xresources`) where Xft.dpi should be increased (220 works perfectly in my case) and reboot you should see the difference. <br>

### Lxappearance 
This software helps you customize the following<br>
* Widget theme: located at `~/.themes`
* Fonts: located  `~/.fonts`) 
* Icon theme: located at `~/.icons`
* Cursor theme: located at `/usr/share/icons`
